Image Capturing from Webcam Python Code

#Importing OpenCV package
import cv2

# Setting the Camera capturing into cam 
cam = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
#Creating a window named as test For capturing the photo
 cv2.namedWindow("test")

# Starting the image capturing from 0
img_counter = 0

# While Condition (True)
while True:

#Returning the cam variable and reading into frame 
ret, frame = cam.read()

# Calling the frame variable and displaying it.
cv2.imshow("frame", frame) 

# If it’s not return then break	
if not ret: 
	
        break
# setting the window to wait until the any key are pressed
    k = cv2.waitKey(1) 

# If condition stating that if 27 ASCII value i.e ESC is pressed than it will close the Test window
    56if k%256 == 27:   
        # ESC pressed
        print("Escape hit, closing...")
        break
# Else if 32 ASCII value i.e Space is pressed than the picture will be captured
    elif k%256 == 32:    
        # SPACE pressed
# Saving the captured image in img_name variable
        img_name = "opencv_frame_{}.png".format(img_counter)

# Writing that image into pyton folder	
      cv2.imwrite(img_name, frame) 
		
# displaying text once the image is captured

        print("{} written!".format(img_name)) 

# increasing the img_counter by 1

        img_counter += 1  
# once the image is captured the cam will be released
cam.release() 

# After capturing it will distroy the running window
cv2.destroyAllWindows() 



Converting RGB image to Grayscale Image

# importing OpenCV package
import cv2 

#reading the image from storage
img = cv2.imread('C:/Users/Jeet/Desktop/image/TT.jpg') 

#coverting the input image to grayscale image
img_gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

#imshow is use for displaying the converted image
cv2.imshow('image', img)

# saving the output image to the given location
cv2.imwrite('C:/Users/Jeet/Desktop/image/Test_gray1.png', img_gray)
